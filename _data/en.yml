research_highlights:
  title: "Rcent Research"
  description: "My recent research focuses on incentive mechanism design and unintended consequences in health insurance payment reforms. By integrating Bayesian persuasion frameworks, and Bunching-DID , I investigate how physicians leverage information asymmetry to induce 'treatment escalation' (supply-side induced demand) and how nonlinear payment schedules trigger strategic bunching behaviors. The goal is to uncover the complex trade-offs between cost containment, moral hazard, and quality of care under DRG/DIP reforms."
  items:
    - title: "Cost-Containment Effects of DIP Reform"
      image: "assets/img/res1.png"
      description: "Physicians' persuasive upcoding behavior increases patient costs, which may significantly undermine the cost-containment goals of the DIP (Diagnosis-Intervention Packet) reform."
      
    - title: "Heterogeneity in DRG Reform"
      image: "assets/img/res2.png"
      description: "Using the Bunching-DID method, we find that DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group) reform may inadvertently increase medical expenses for patients below the deductible threshold."
